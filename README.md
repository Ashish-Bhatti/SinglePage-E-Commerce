E-Commerce Project (Single-Page)
Challenges Faced
-Local Storage with Objects: 
  One of the challenges in this project was working with Local Storage to save and retrieve cart data, 
  especially since we were dealing with objects. In previous projects like the Expense Tracker, we had worked with arrays in Local Storage. 
  Transitioning to objects required extra effort to properly serialize and deserialize the data. Ensuring the cart was correctly stored and 
  loaded from Local Storage was a key learning point.
  
-Main Focus on JavaScript: 
  The main focus of this project was to strengthen our JavaScript skills. While building this e-commerce site, we focused on mastering key JavaScript concepts 
  such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing asynchronous data fetching. We kept the HTML and CSS minimal to keep the attention on the core functionality, 
  ensuring the JavaScript logic for cart management, applying discounts, and handling the checkout process was solid.
